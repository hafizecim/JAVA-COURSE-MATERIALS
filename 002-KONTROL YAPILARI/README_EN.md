# ðŸ§­ 2. CONTROL STRUCTURES (Java Control Structures)

This section covers the core concepts of **decision making**, **repetition**, and **user input** in Java.  
These structures make programs dynamic â€” allowing them to react based on user input, conditions, or loops.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. CONDITIONS

Conditions determine which block of code runs depending on whether a statement is **true** or **false**.

### ðŸ”¸ Structures:
- **if** â†’ Executes code when the condition is true  
- **else if** â†’ Tests multiple conditions sequentially  
- **else** â†’ Runs if no other condition is true  
- **switch-case** â†’ Chooses a block based on a specific value  

### ðŸ§© Common Uses:
- Decision-making (e.g., age check, grade evaluation)
- Menu selections
- Controlling program flow

## ðŸ”¹ 2. LOOPS

Loops are used to **repeat** actions multiple times.  
They continue running as long as a certain condition is true.

### ðŸ”¸ Types of Loops:
- **for** â†’ Repeats a fixed number of times  
- **while** â†’ Repeats while a condition is true  
- **do-while** â†’ Executes once before checking the condition  
- **nested loops** â†’ A loop inside another loop  

### ðŸ”¸ Control Statements:
- **break** â†’ Stops the loop immediately  
- **continue** â†’ Skips the current iteration  

### ðŸ§© Common Uses:
- Generating tables
- Drawing patterns
- Iterating through lists or data

## ðŸ”¹ 3. USER INPUT

To get input from the user, we use the `Scanner` class.

### ðŸ§© Basic Example:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
int number = input.nextInt();
System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
